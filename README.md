# jekyll-bootstrap5
A blank jekyll site with latest Bootstrap.
This is forked from [marcanuy/jekyll-bootstrap4](https://github.com/marcanuy/jekyll-bootstrap4/tree/83c366258eabfec44f81786bba1c835a93d7e624).

# Test & Modify
jekyll-bootstrap5 can be used as a starter theme for theming jekyll with Bootstrap. Just run these commands and you'll have a Bootstrap-flavored jekyll:

```
git clone https://github.com/kiarashazimzadeh/jekyll-bootstrap.git
cd jekyll-bootstrap5/
make serve
```

> :warning: GitHub Pages generator is NOT included! It'll be added as soon as possible.
